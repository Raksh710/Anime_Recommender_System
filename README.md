# Anime_Recommender_System
Recommends Anime using Content based filtering and collaborative filtering (using KNN). <br>
Overall, in this case, Content based filtering (using TFIDF Vectorizer) Outperformed Collaborative Filtering (using KNN). <br>
Although, Collaborative filtering gave good results, but Content based filtering gave extremely good results. <br>
